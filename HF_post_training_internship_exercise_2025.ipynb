        "Welcome to the Hugging Face internship exercise! In our recent blog post on [_Scaling Test-Time Compute with Open Models_](https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/blogpost-scaling-test-time-compute), we explored how search methods and reward models can be used to enhance the performance of LLMs on math problems.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this exercise, you will be replicating a baseline method from this approach: **Best-of-N sampling with _weighted_ selection**. This approach involves sampling $N$ independent solutions per problem, scoring the solutions with a reward model, and then grouping solutions with the same final answer. The rewards are then summed per group and the final answer with the highest weighted score is chosen as the Best-of-N solution. For more details, refer to the [DeepMind](http://hf.co/papers) and [Math-Shepherd](https://huggingface.co/papers/2312.08935) papers.\n",
        "\n",
        "We will use the following models from the Hugging Face Hub:\n",
        "- [**Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct**](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct): A 1.5 billion parameter chat model with decent math capabilities for its size.\n",
        "- [**Skywork/Skywork-o1-Open-PRM-Qwen-2.5-1.5B**](https://huggingface.co/Skywork/Skywork-o1-Open-PRM-Qwen-2.5-1.5B): a 1.5 billion parameter process reward model (PRM). Unlike conventional reward models, PRMs are trained to provide a _sequence_ of scores, one for each step in the LLM's reasoning process.\n",
        "\n",
        "💡 These models are small enough to run on Google Colab using a free T4 GPU, so make sure you have activated this runtime before progressing!\n",
        "\n",
        "Concretely, we would like you to work through the following steps:\n",
        "1. Create a filtered subset of 20 level 1-3 problems from the [MATH-500 dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/HuggingFaceH4/MATH-500) (smol models cannot really solve the harder levels). Using these problems:\n",
        "  - Generate $N=1$ solutions for each problem using greedy decoding; this will be used as a baseline. We recommend prompting the model with chain-of-thought and instructing it to ensure the final answers are contained in `\\boxed{answer}` (this helps with parsing).\n",
        "  - Compute the accuracy of your solutions compared to the ground truth.\n",
        "3. Sample $N=16$ solutions per problem and score them using the Skywork reward model. Although this model is a PRM, we will use the **_last step prediction_** as our final reward for the full solution. Refer to Appendix E of the [DeepMind](http://hf.co/papers) paper for guidance on using the last step prediction; this involves selecting the final score in the PRM's output sequence.\n",
        "4. Using the solutions and rewards from Step 2, compute the Best-of-N accuracy with _**weighted**_ selection.\n",
        "5. Create a dataset of the problems with the greedy and Best-of-N model solutions and push it to the Hugging Face Hub. Then, create a basic [dataset card](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/datasets-cards) that describes how the dataset was constructed.\n",
        "6. Create some plots and analysis of the performance of this approach compared to the greedy baseline. For example, which problems was Best-of-N able to solve that greedy decoding couldn't? If time permits, explore how other parameters impact the performance. For example, how accuracy varies with $N$ or temperature.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Try to spend ~3 hours on the exercise.**\n",
        "\n",
        "## Tips\n",
        "\n",
        "* Some steps in the exercise can take ~15 minutes to run on Colab. We recommend familiarising yourself with the remaining steps while waiting for the code to run.\n",
        "* You can use this [simple helper function](https://gist.github.com/lewtun/9c2ce1937b741404090a3dc4c7c022b3) to extract the answers from the `\\boxed{answer}` substrings. In practice, we would use SymPy equivalence but that adds extra complexity.\n",
        "* The Skywork reward model uses custom modelling code and must be loaded with `trust_remote_code=True`. The authors provide a [repo](https://github.com/SkyworkAI/skywork-o1-prm-inference) with some inference code, but it is possible to use the model directly in `transformers` with `AutoModel.from_pretrained(...)`. You may want to refer to the repo for the PRM scoring helper functions. You will also need to normalize the output logits with a sigmoid function!\n",
        "* You are welcome to use LLMs (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, DeepSeek V3, etc) to help you solve this exercise! The only thing we ask is that you indicate which parts of the code were co-authored by an LLM, and that you could explain how the code works if asked :)\n",

        "## Assessment rubric\n",
        "\n",
        "What we want to see is whether:\n",
        "\n",
        "- You have hands-on knowledge of Python and a basic familiarity with the Hugging Face ecosystem.\n",
        "- You have a good understanding of prompting LLMs and how to generate responses from them.\n",
        "- You know how to use reward models to improve the quality of language model responses.\n",
        "- Your code and written explanations can be understood by others. In particular, we like to see simple, readable code over complex over-engineered solutions.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "We're especially interested in understanding how you approach projects, so it is important that you can explain the steps you take throughout the notebook. We want to understand what you have tried, so you will be evaluated on your comments just as much as the code itself.\n",
        "\n",
        "If you feel that you are spending much longer on this exercise than the allotted time, please stop and simply jot down ideas for next steps if you had more time.\n",
        "\n",

        "## Summary\n",
        "\n",
        "### Approach Description\n",
        "\n",
        "I use two models:\n",
        "* **Greedy decoding**: Chooses the token with the highest probability at each step without sampling.\n",
        "* **Weighted Best-of-N**: Samples the next token with a temperature of 0.8.\n",
        "\n",
        "Both approaches share a 1-shot prompt with an example sampled randomly from a training set. The reported results are from a test set of 20 problems.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Results\n",
        "\n",
        "A dataset with the results is available [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/cmpatino/math500_post-training).\n",
        "\n",
        "The figure below shows the expected behavior: the weighted Best-of-N outperforms the greedy approach as we increase the number of generations. I also include the vanilla Best-of-N approach, which outperforms the greedy approach but performs worse than the weighted Best-of-N. The weighted Best-of-N method saturates at an accuracy of 0.9, which is a 0.95 accuracy (see comment 1. in the *Additional Comments* section for details).\n",
        "\n",
        "![model_comparison](model_comparison.png)\n",
        "\n",
        "### Error Discussion\n",
        "\n",
        "The problems that the Best-of-N got right and the greedy approach got wrong are problems in which the greedy approach follows the right process but makes a mistake in a single step. The multiple generations used in the Best-of-N approach help mitigate these specific errors because they give multiple opportunities to repeat the process without mistakes in the steps that the greedy approach misses.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, the greedy approach has the correct process except for calculating the perimeter of the rectangle instead of the sum of two sides in problem `test/prealgebra/1252.json`. Some of the generations in the Best-of-N approach get that specific step right, and that's why it gets to the correct answer after the response aggregation.\n",
        "\n",
        "In my experiments, the Best-of-N method answered correctly all the problems the greedy approach answered correctly. That's why I don't have instances to analyze the greedy approach's advantage over the Best-of-N approach with 16 generations. The Best-of-N method performs worse than the greedy approach for less than three generations, but that behavior is related to the temperature setting, as discussed in the [Hugging Face blog post](https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/blogpost-scaling-test-time-compute).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Additional Comments\n",
        "1. Comparing the model's answers with the true answers is tricky because they may express the same answer differently. The problem is mitigated using sympy to get the simplified expressions, but I still have errors. For example, I get that both approaches get the `test/precalculus/441.json` problem wrong. However, the Best-of-N method got the correct answer, but there was a problem with parsing the true solution.\n",
        "2. I set the maximum response length to 1024 tokens because I noticed that the generation was interrupted by the 512 limit. I also mitigated this interruption by asking the model to give short answers. After including these two fixes, no model had the problem of being interrupted."

        "* Exclude problems with a description or a solution with more characters than the 0.9 length quantile. This criterion excludes problems over 250 characters and solutions over 1000 characters.

I used a 1-shot prompt because of the time and computational constraints, but this is a hyperparameter I could tune to achieve better performance. The Qwen model can handle 4-shot prompts or higher because of its context length of 128k tokens."
